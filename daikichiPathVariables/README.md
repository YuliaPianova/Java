4. Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/travel/kyoto' where the url will take any string for the city, 
and display text that says for example, 'Congratulations! You will soon travel to kyoto!'.

5. Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/lotto/8', where the url will take any integer.

If it is odd, display text that says "You have enjoyed the fruits of your labor but now is a great time to spend time with family and friends."
